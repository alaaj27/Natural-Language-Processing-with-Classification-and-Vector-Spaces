# WEEK2: Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis on tweets

Welcome to week two of this specialization. You will learn about Naive Bayes. Concretely, you will be using Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, you will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Specifically you will:

* Train a naive bayes model on a sentiment analysis task
* Test using your model
* Compute ratios of positive words to negative words
* Do some error analysis
* Predict on your own tweet

You may already be familiar with Naive Bayes and its justification in terms of conditional probabilities and independence.
* In this week's lectures and assignments we used the ratio of probabilities between positive and negative sentiment.
* This approach gives us simpler formulas for these 2-way classification tasks.
