# WEEK 1: Logistic Regression
Welcome to week one of this specialization. You will learn about logistic regression. Concretely, you will be implementing logistic regression for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, you will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Specifically you will:

* Learn how to extract features for logistic regression given some text
* Implement logistic regression from scratch
* Apply logistic regression on a natural language processing task
* Test using your logistic regression
* Perform error analysis

We will be using a data set of tweets. Hopefully you will get more than 99% accuracy.
